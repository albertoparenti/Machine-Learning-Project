# Machine Learning Project

## Introduction 

The following project aims to analyse and build a prediction model based on the data of a Portuguese online company “Tech-Scape”, which was founded in early 2020. The company was largely affected by the recent Coronavirus pandemic during its beginning phase, leading to a decrease in revenues, and gradually reactivating their business by April 2020. 

With the main goal of increasing their sales, the company was interested in analysing the online behaviour of their customers, by predicting which ones are more likely to buy their products depending on their online actions. To fulfill this goal, data from the company’s customer action and purchases from 2020, was analysed and several predictive models were built and tested. The following report aims to portray this process and its results.
